Here is the revised article with added evidence from the Qur'an:

**Islam promotes peace, security, and justice as core values essential for building harmonious societies.** The teachings of Islam emphasize that peace (*Salam*) is not only the absence of conflict but also a state of well-being and balance, achieved through justice and compassion for others. This is reflected in the Qur'an and Hadith, which guide Muslims toward peaceful coexistence and the resolution of conflicts through dialogue and fairness.

One of the key principles in Islam is justice, as peace cannot be attained without addressing the legitimate grievances of all parties involved. The Qur'an encourages believers to "stand out firmly for justice" even if it is against their own interests or the interests of their close relations:

> "O you who have believed, be persistently standing firm in justice, witnesses for Allah, even if it be against yourselves or parents and relatives..."  
> (Qur'an 4:135)

This highlights the importance of objectivity and fairness in all matters, whether personal, communal, or international. Moreover, Islam strongly advocates for peaceful resolutions to conflicts. In the Qur'an, Allah commands believers to incline towards peace if the other party shows a willingness to do so:

> "But if they incline to peace, you also incline to it, and (put your) trust in Allah. Verily, He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower."  
> (Qur'an 8:61)

Islamic scholars also stress the importance of forgiveness, charity, and compassion in maintaining peace. The process of reconciliation, referred to as *Sulha*, involves peaceful negotiations and conflict resolution aimed at restoring relationships between disputing parties. In early Islamic history, Muslim jurists developed legal frameworks for mediation and arbitration to resolve disputes amicably, a practice that continues in modern Islamic conflict resolution methods.

Furthermore, the spiritual aspect of peace in Islam is significant. Personal transformation through acts such as prayer (*Salah*), remembrance of God (*Dhikr*), and fasting (*Sawm*) is seen as vital to developing inner peace, which in turn contributes to peaceful relationships with others.

To achieve peace through Islam, it is essential to foster a mindset rooted in justice, compassion, and reconciliation while promoting ethical behavior and spiritual growth. By living in accordance with these principles, individuals and communities can work toward lasting peace and security.
